# callService.py,
#
# Execute the clustering service using job process, for wich a service call in background need to be done.
# All clustering process will be addressed with their own parameter and answers.
#
# Receives a normalized dataset, job id and user id. The data will be used to save information in user's personal path.
#
# Returns information as an csv file, calinski medition and sihouette through two histogram. Finally a json file with the process resume.
#
# NOTE: in the clustering service all methods are tested without the user confirmation. Thus this service implementation is easier than the supervised learning service
#
# python modules in the directory of the same, in order to be able to be
# recognized from any python call and be indexed within the library itself.
